REFLECTIONS

1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git folder holding the change information. Can decide which files to track. 
Need to do it because it doesn't do it automatically, so you have control over which 
directories you want to control.


2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Not 100% sure yet. It's different from the working directory as you've chosen specific files to be in there,
the value it offers is having more control over which files are gitted.


3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Not really sure.


4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

different languages
new development ideas
someone else adding or modifying code
trying to fix bugs while keeping stable version 
different beta tests
A/B testing


5. How do the diagrams help you visualise the branch structure?

Easier to see on paper than on git output.


6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram in the way we do?

Combines the changes from each of the branches into the current branch.
